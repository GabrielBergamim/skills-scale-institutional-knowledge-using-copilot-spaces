## Responsibility Matrix (RACI)

Use this matrix to clarify ownership and accountability across key project activities. Roles: **R** = Responsible (does the work), **A** = Accountable (final decision), **C** = Consulted (provides input), **I** = Informed (kept updated).

| Activity | PM | PdM | Dev | BA | UX | QA | DevOps |
|----------|----|----|-----|----|----|----|----|
| Define problem statement | C | A | I | C | C | I | I |
| Gather requirements | C | C | I | A/R | C | C | I |
| Design user experience | I | C | C | C | A/R | C | I |
| Develop features | C | C | A/R | C | C | C | C |
| Write acceptance criteria | C | C | C | R | C | A/R | I |
| Test strategy & execution | C | I | C | I | C | A/R | C |
| Code review | I | I | A/R | I | I | C | C |
| CI/CD pipeline setup | I | I | C | I | I | C | A/R |
| Deployment execution | R | I | C | I | I | C | A/R |
| Release decision | A/R | C | I | I | I | C | I |
| Risk management | A/R | C | C | C | C | C | C |
| Stakeholder communication | A/R | R | I | C | I | I | I |
| Retrospective facilitation | A/R | C | R | R | R | R | R |

**Notes:**
- Multiple roles can be Responsible for collaborative activities
- Only one role should be Accountable for each activity
- Adjust based on your team structure and project needs

## Common Collaboration Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Unclear Requirements
**Symptoms**: Frequent clarification requests, rework, missed acceptance criteria  
**Solution**:
- Business Analyst schedules requirements review with PM, PdM, and key stakeholders
- Use the "Three Amigos" meeting (BA, Dev, QA) to validate stories before sprint
- Adopt a requirements checklist to ensure completeness

### Challenge: Design-Development Misalignment
**Symptoms**: Implementation doesn't match designs, late design changes  
**Solution**:
- UX Designer conducts design handoff sessions with Developers
- Use design review checkpoints at wireframe and high-fidelity stages
- Developers flag technical constraints early in the design process

### Challenge: Late Quality Issues
**Symptoms**: Bugs found in production, missed acceptance criteria  
**Solution**:
- QA Lead participates in requirements and design reviews to catch testability issues
- Developers and QA collaborate on test automation during development
- Implement shift-left testing practices

### Challenge: Deployment Delays
**Symptoms**: Last-minute environment issues, failed deployments  
**Solution**:
- DevOps Engineer participates in planning to identify infrastructure needs early
- Establish regular deployment rehearsals in staging environments
- Maintain deployment runbooks and rollback procedures

### Challenge: Communication Gaps
**Symptoms**: Missed hand-offs, duplicated work, conflicting assumptions  
**Solution**:
- Project Manager facilitates regular cross-functional sync meetings
- Use the responsibility matrix (RACI) to clarify ownership
- Document decisions in a shared location (wiki, project board, etc.)

## Best Practices for Collaboration

1. **Over-communicate early**: Share context, constraints, and assumptions upfront to prevent rework.
2. **Use the RACI matrix**: When in doubt about ownership, refer to the responsibility matrix.
3. **Document decisions**: Capture key decisions and rationale in a shared location.
4. **Respect hand-off protocols**: Complete your deliverables before passing to the next role.
5. **Ask questions**: If something is unclear, ask early rather than making assumptions.
6. **Provide feedback constructively**: Focus on solutions and improvements, not blame.
7. **Celebrate successes**: Recognize cross-team collaboration wins in retrospectives.
